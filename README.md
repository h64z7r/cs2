Practice Sheet 07
1)    The Direct Form. I and Direct   Form. II   of digital   filters   are   depicted   in   the   diagrams   below.
Let   the   input   initial   conditions   be   x[0]   =   −1   and   x[1]   =   2.   Find   y0   ,   y1   ,   t0   ,   t1    such   that,   if   yI [i] = yII [i] = yi and t   [i] = ti,   i = 0, 1,    then the two forms are equivalent, i.e.,   yI [n]   =   yII    [n] ,   ∀n   ∈   Z.
2)    Let   y [n]   be   the   output   of a   linear   system   as   depicted   below

(a)    Convert   the   block   diagram   into   代 写Digital Signal Processing and Digital Filters Practice Sheet 07Python

(b)    Derive the transfer   function   of the   original block   diagram   and   compute the   values   of   b [i] ,   i   =   0, 1, 2   and   a   [i] ,   i   =   0, 1   from   its   Direct   Form   I/II   representation   as   shown in   the   diagram   of   Question   1.
3)    Let   a   linear   system   be   described   by

(a)    Calculate   the   zeros   and   poles   of the   system.
(b)      Write   the   system   as   the   product   of two   biquads   such   that   ensure   a   low   peak   gain.
